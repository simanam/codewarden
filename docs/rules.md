Got it. I'll follow this rule: Commands I'll ask you to run:
Installing system tools (Python, Node.js, pnpm, Docker)
Setting up development environment
Running/starting the project
Any commands that modify your system configuration
Commands I can run myself:
Running tests (pytest, vitest, npm test)
Linting and type checking
Building the project
Git operations (status, diff, commit when requested)
File searches and exploration
This keeps you in control of your environment setup while I handle verification and testing tasks. Ready to start Phase 1.1 when you give the go-ahead!
